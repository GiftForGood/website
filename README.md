This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js 10.13](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later

## Setting up

Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all the relevant dependencies such as React, Next.js etc.   

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `next`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Hot reloading is available in this mode, i.e. the page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start` or `next start`

Starts a Next.js production server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Take note to build the app using `npm run dev` or `next` before starting the server.<br />

### `npm run build` or `next build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br />

### `npm run export` or `next build && next export`

Exports your app into static HTML, which can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server. The static version of the app will be available in the `out` directory.
