# How to better write your wish description

**Things to take note**
1. Provide as much details about your wish as you can! 
    - Doing so will reduce the need for back and forth communication between you and donors
2. If you require large quantity items, try to break your wish down to a size that is manageable by one donor. This is so that your wish can be fulfilled in a shorter period of time.
3. If you require specific type/brand of item, please list it down within the wish description as well.
4. If you require new item, do indicate. 

**Sample wish description**
```

Specific Item: Dettol Hand Sanitizers

Quantity Required: 100

Delivery Required: Yes
